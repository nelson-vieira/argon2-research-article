However both these changes cannot be described as well-considered. One of them results in an approximate relation between any four consecutive additive constants.

Compared to the previous construction from Eurocrypt 2007, this paper describes a more flexible family of differential paths and a new variable birthdaying search space. Combined with a time-memory trade-off, these improvements lead to just three pairs of near-collision blocks to generate the collision, enabling construction of RSA moduli that are sufficiently short to be accepted by current CAs. The entire construction is fast enough to allow for adequate prediction of certificate serial number and validity period: it can be made to require about 249 MD5 compression function calls. Finally, we improve the complexity of identical-prefix collisions for MD5 to about 216 MD5 compression function calls and use it to derive a practical single-block chosen-prefix collision construction of which an example is given.",

abstract="A password-based key derivation function (KDF) -- a function that derives cryptographic keys from a password -- is necessary in many security applications. Like any password-based schemes, such KDFs are subject to key search attacks (often called dictionary attacks). Salt and iteration count are used in practice to significantly increase the workload of such attacks. These techniques have also been specified in widely adopted industry standards such as PKCS and IETF. Despite the importance and wide-spread usage, there has been no formal security analysis on existing constructions. In this paper, we propose a general security framework for password-based KDFs and introduce two security definitions each capturing a different attacking scenario. We study the most commonly used construction H(c)(p||s) and prove that the iteration count c, when fixed, does have an effect of stretching the password p by log2c bits. We then analyze the two standardized KDFs in PKCS{\#}5. We show that both are secure if the adversary cannot influence the parameters but subject to attacks otherwise. Finally, we propose a new password-based KDF that is provably secure even when the adversary has full control of the parameters.",
